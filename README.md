## Git Commit Flow

You can...

- Commit the "normal" way: `git add . && git commit -m "added a new feature"`
- Or you can commit with more meaningful commit messages: `git add . && git cz`
  - this will take you through an interactive process of writing commit messages.
  - Only the type of change and the short description are mandatory fields.
